# Prework

Hey everyone, this markdown file will go over the prework that you will need to do in order to follow along with some later MIDI usage!

The prework is catered for MacOS, but every file/application has a windows alternative that I will also link.

## Downloads

### JuicySF

1. Download the corresponding `.tar.xfz` or `.zip` for your system:

    * MacOS: https://github.com/Birch-san/juicysfplugin/releases/tag/2.3.3.macOS 
    * Windows: https://github.com/Birch-san/juicysfplugin/releases/tag/3.1.0 

    Note: The MacOS version release is older than Windows because I ran into errors with 3.1.0 and 3.0.0 on Mac.  
    The reason I want Windows users to use 3.1.0 is because release 3.0.0 was the first time they released a standalone `.exe` for windows. (No one likes installing things on Windows when it can be a portable app)
